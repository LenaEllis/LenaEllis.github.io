    <h2>A Little About Myself</h2><br/>
    <p>Hi, I'm Lena! I want to be a developer someday and this seems like a good way to start!
        I love video games and play them whenever I have any down time. 
        I can get distracted when I'm working, but that's part of my process! You have to have a little fun when you're working right? 
        I'm a procrastinator, but stuff you give me will always be done by the deadline given. 
    </p><br/>
    <h2>Hobbies and Insterests</h2><br/>
    <p>As said before, video games is one of main hobbies. I tend to hyperfixate on one game for at least a week. 
        My favorite type of games are story rich games. I find that they give me the same feeling of reading a book. 
        Singing is also a hobbie. I sing for class, but I also sing for fun! I just love music in general!
