    <p>Hi, I'm Lena! I want to be a developer someday and this seems like a good way to start!
        I love video games and play them whenever I have any down time. 
        I can get distracted when I'm working, but that's part of my process! You have to have a little fun when you're working right? 
        I'm a procrastinator, but stuff you give me will always be done by the deadline given. 
    </p>
