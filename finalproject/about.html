    <h1>Welcome! Here's my "business card".</h1><br/>
    <h2>Location</h2><br/>
    <p>I work in Janesville, Wisconsin. I don't plan on moving around for my business as it is mostly digital.</p><br/>
    <h2>Educational Background</h2><br/>
    <p>Right now, I'm a Junior in High School. I've taken different computer classes, that's how I actually know how to make my own website.
        I've always exceled in English and Writing classes, so I thought writing would be fairly easy! I however, did not account for my frequent writers block.
        I enjoy coding and writing because I like to think of myself as creative and insperation can really take a hold of me! Coding and writing really gives me the creative freedom to do so.
    </p>
    <h2>What I Can Offer You</h2>
    <p>You might be thinking right now, "Yeah, this is fine and dandy, but what am I getting out of you?" Well, allow me to tell you!
        Everyone can be inspired and insperation is a beatiful thing, but sometimes, people don't know what to do with it. Well, that's what I'm here for!
        I want to see your insperation come to life, so with some help from you of telling me what you would like to see, I'll write your insperation in the form of a story.
        It can be however long you desire it to be. 
        Have a change you want in the middle of writing? No problem! Just tell me the change and where you want it to go in your story, and it will be changed.
