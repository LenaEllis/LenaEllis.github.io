    <h1>Welcome! Here's my "business card".</h1><br/>
    <h2>Location</h2><br/>
    <p>I work in Janesville, Wisconsin. I don't plan on moving around for my business as it is mostly digital.</p><br/>
    <h2>Educational Background</h2><br/>
    <p>Right now, I'm a Junior in High School. I've taken different computer classes, that's how I actually know how to make my own website.
        I've always exceled in English and Writing classes, so I thought writing would be fairly easy.
