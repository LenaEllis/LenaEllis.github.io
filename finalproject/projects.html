                <td> <p>For a class, we had to make our own card game. It could be anything we wanted so I chose a game about the year of 2020. 
                    The directions will be attached. I enjoyed making it, but it took quite a bit of time before a had a clear picture in mind of the game, but once I had it, I couldn't stop typing the directions.
                    The Google Doc that has the rules to the game will be at the bottom of this table.</p>
