    <h1>Welcome! Here's my "business card".</h1><br/>
    <h2>Location</h2><br/>
    <p>I work in Janesville, Wisconsin. I don't plan on moving around for my business as it is mostly digital.</p><br/>
    <h2>Educational Background</h2><br/>
    <p>Right now, I'm a Junior in High School. I've taken different computer classes, that's how I actually know how to make my own website.
        I've always exceled in English and Writing classes, so I thought writing would be fairly easy! I however, did not account for my frequent writers block.
        I enjoy coding and writing because I like to think of myself as creative and insperation can really take a hold of me! Coding and writing really gives me the creative freedom to do so.
    </p><br/>
    <h2>Work and Volunteering Experience</h2><br/>
    <h3>Work</h3><br/>
    <p>For about six months, I worked at Mounds Petfood Wearhouse. I was a stocker and did a lot of the heavy lifting, but I also worked at the register.
        Register was harder as I'm not overly quick at math and tend to stumble over my words when talking out of anxiety. 
        Now, I help my mom around our house as my mom is a busy nurse and during the summer I help out with yard work.
    </p><br/>
    <h3>Volunteer</h3><br/>
    <p>I work in my community quite a bit. For the longest time, I volunteered at St. Pauls, a school and church that I had gone to for about twelve years.
        I pasted out bulitons, helped collect the offerings, and even ran the projection screen on Saturday nights. 
        I Volunteer at Faith Community now, the church I go to now. My mom and I help by volunteering with Angle Tree, food boxes, and cookie making.
        I plan to eventually volunteer at Noah's Ark or The Humane Society as I love animals.
